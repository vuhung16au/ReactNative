drawer - Drawer navigation screens
modal - Modal screen examples
fonts - Font demonstration screens
not-found.tsx - Custom 404 page
Next Steps
The application is now fully functional with all the requested features implemented. If you want to enhance it further, you could:

Add more interactivity (like state management for a shopping cart)
Implement theme switching (dark/light mode)
Add animations for smoother transitions
Implement data persistence with AsyncStorage
Add proper image assets instead of placeholder images
Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail or help with any additional features?
```

# Step 4
