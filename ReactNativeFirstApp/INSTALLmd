## Clean Build, Build, and Run the React Native App

This guide explains how to clean, build, and run the app in development mode on **macOS**
---

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)
- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) (macOS/Linux, optional but recommended)
- [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
- **Xcode** (for iOS, macOS only)

---

## Using a `.env` File for API Keys

To securely manage API keys and environment variables, use a `.env` file in your project root. This file should **not** be committed to version control (add `.env` to your `.gitignore`).

### 1. Create a `.env` file
In the root of your project, create a file named `.env`:

```
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ANOTHER_SECRET=your_other_secret
```

### 2. Install Environment Variable Library
Install a library to load environment variables in React Native. Common options:
- [`react-native-dotenv`](https://github.com/goatandsheep/react-native-dotenv)
- [`react-native-config`](https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config)

Example (using `react-native-config`):
```
npm install react-native-config
```

Follow the library's setup instructions for iOS.
